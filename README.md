# HexGame

This is our Hex Game project that we created for our Visual Programming course.

## Abstract
The Hex gaming project aims to create an interactive, two-player board game using JavaFX. The game involves players taking turns coloring hexagonal cells on a grid in an attempt to combine opposite sides with their colors. The project implements important game mechanics, including motion recording, swap rule, win detection and visual feedback through an engaging user interface.

## Software Design
-HexGame: The main class that sets up the game and handles primary game logic.
-HexBoard: Manages the creation and interactions of the hexagonal board.
-HexCell: Represents a single hexagonal cell.
-GameController: Handles game-specific logic such as checking for a win, swapping rules, and managing turns.
-UIController: Manages the user interface elements like starting screen, game screen, and winner screen.
#### Vehicles Used:
-Java: The primary programming language for game logic and application structure.
-JavaFX: The framework for creating the graphical user interface.
-IDE: An Integrated Development Environment for writing, debugging, and testing code (for example, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
